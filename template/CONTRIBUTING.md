# Contributing

We want this community to be friendly and respectful to each other. Please follow it in all your interactions with the project.

## Development workflow

To get started with the project, run `yarn` in the root directory to install the required dependencies for each package:

```sh
yarn
```

To start the packager:

```sh
yarn start
```

To run the app on Android:

```sh
yarn android
```

To run the app on iOS:

```sh
yarn ios
```

Make sure your code passes ESLint. Run the following to verify:

```sh
yarn lint
```

To fix formatting errors, run the following:

```sh
yarn lint --fix
```

### Project structure

**Consistency is key**, this is the base structure we want all our projects to follow, whatever you need to add to it so it better suits your needs stick to it 100%, be consistent!

Folder by folder this is what we put in each top level directory:

- `app` - miscellaneous stuff that applies to the entirety of the app. Singletons, utility functions, services, store config.
- `assets` - multimedia files that you need.
- `components` - reusable components like buttons, links, cards, modals...
- `features` - here we shall put a folder for each top level feature of the app, for instance, if we offer a counter like we do in the example there should be a `counter` folder here containing the following files at least:
  * `Counter.js` - the React component that will be shown to the user and associated to the route in the appropriate navigator. It should follow these basic guidelines (the linter will help you with the rest):
    - First the component. Always functional and logic handled with hooks. Don't do `export const`, just `const`.
    - Then styles declared using `createStyleFactory` (consumed within the component with `useStyles`).
    - Component export as `default`.
  * `counterAPI.js` - functions to call the API. **It should not export a class with static methods**, just functions. These functions should be declared using `baseService` so error handling is kept consistent.
  * `counterSlice.js` - redux module for this feature. This file should more or less resemble the following structure:
    - Declare the initial state as a constant.
    - Declare all async actions using `createAsyncThunk`.
    - Declare the slice with all sync actions handled in `reducers` and async actions handled in `extraReducers` with `builder` notation.
    - Export all synchronous actions as named exports.
    - Base selector as plain arrow function.
    - Declare and export specific memoized selectors.
    - Export the reducer as default.
  
  Should there be any dependencies exclusive to the `Counter` component, be it components you only use here or you just want to split the component because it's getting too large then consider a structure similar to that of fractal.

  If there is a feature like `error` or `status` in the example, hence, that does not need any particular UI, do feel free to omit the component.
- `hooks` - reusable hooks, similar in concept to the `components` folder.
- `localization` - handle i18n here.
- `navigation` - put all your navigators here.
- `theme` - colors, dimensions, nail polish...

### Commit message convention

We follow the [conventional commits specification](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en) for our commit messages:

- `fix`: bug fixes, e.g. fix crash due to deprecated method.
- `feat`: new features, e.g. add new method to the module.
- `refactor`: code refactor, e.g. migrate from class components to hooks.
- `docs`: changes into documentation, e.g. add usage example for the module..
- `test`: adding or updating tests, e.g. add integration tests using detox.
- `chore`: tooling changes, e.g. change CI config.

Our pre-commit hooks verify that your commit message matches this format when committing.

### Linting and tests

[ESLint](https://eslint.org/), [Prettier](https://prettier.io/)

We use [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) with [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) for linting and formatting the code.

> **Is the linter bullying you?** We're sorry but it's there for a reason, try to comply with it as much as humanly possible. If you think you run into an edge case and want to disable it add a comment nearby so we know why and whoever reviews the PR can propose alternatives if they can think of any.

Our pre-commit hooks verify that the linter passes when committing.

### Sending a pull request

> **Working on your first pull request?** You can learn how from this _free_ series: [How to Contribute to an Open Source Project on GitHub](https://egghead.io/series/how-to-contribute-to-an-open-source-project-on-github).

When you're sending a pull request:

- Prefer small pull requests focused on one change.
- Verify that linters are passing.
