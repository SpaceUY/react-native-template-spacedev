      |=   =|       Thanks for using the SpaceDev react-native template!
      |     |
      |     |       This template is designed for internal use at SpaceDev (https://spacedev.uy/)
      |     |       so this is not intended to be a minimal boilerplate by any means.
      |     |
      |     |       To get started remember to check out the template's readme and
      |     |       this project's contributing guidelines! They'll help you make
      |     |       better contributions in less time.
